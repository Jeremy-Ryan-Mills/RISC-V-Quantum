# RISC-V with Quantum ISA Extension

This is a RISC-V processor project with an extended instruction set for superconducting qubit control. This is a personal project in order to learn Verilog and apply my knowledge of Quantum Control Electronics to a project.

## Tesbenches

I am going to use SystemVerilog testbenches ith an Icarus Verilog backend to test the RISC-V Components of the CPU. I will verify the quantum extension to the ISA with Cocotb because it is easier to verify RF signals.
